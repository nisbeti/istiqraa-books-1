<p><span class="anchor" id="p3"></span>The two titles are contemporary to each other and have many entries in common. The slight difference is that the second of the two titles tends to give a brief introduction of each work as well as the details of its re-prints and reviews (if any) . Both of them cover material that has been written in other European languages, but this is tiny compared to the level of material in English. For example, Ahmad von Denffer’s book shows ٥٥٩ entries, ~٣٦٠ of which are in English. As a researcher, my task was to enhance the material previously available. By presenting this bibliography, I am confident that it covers almost all the relevant material published between ١٩٨٠ and June ٢٠٠٣. As perfectness belongs only to Allah, I can only say that I have exerted all my abilities to collect the information available (in a very busy period of my life!) ; any material that has inadvertently missed my notice can be added to a later edition, if Allah wills.<a href="#p3" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p4"></span>I note with great appreciation that the last twenty two years have witnessed a burgeoning in the translation into English of original texts of Hadith, such as the Sunan Abu Dawud and a part of Nasa’i; a combined collection of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim; Tafsir Ibn Kathir (in ten volumes) , which in my opinion is a Tafsir based mainly on Hadith and and so deserves its place in Hadith literature. This period has also seen many publications refuting the ill-conceived critical studies done by Goldziher and Schacht in<a href="#p4" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p> </div>
