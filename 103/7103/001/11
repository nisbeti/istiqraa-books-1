<p><span class="anchor" id="p2"></span>After offering my gratitude to Allah Almighty, I must admit that this enormous task could not have been completed in such a short space of time without the following helping hands to whom I am greatly indebted:<a href="#p2" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p3"></span>١. My younger brother, Dr. Suhail Hasan, a research fellow at the International Islamic University of Islamabad, who made access to its library possible for me.<a href="#p3" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p4"></span>٢. My son, Dr. Usama Hasan in Islamabad, who managed to send all my notes and cataloguing cards to London when I inadvertently left them behind in Pakistan.<a href="#p4" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p5"></span>٣. My son-in-law Shaharuddin Zainuddin, who offered his personal collection of books for my research and took me for a tour of the libraries of Bahrain.<a href="#p5" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p6"></span>٤. Brother Naimuddin, Mr. Khalid Nadawi (research scholar) and Mr. Abdul Hayy (librarian) from the Islamic Foundation in Leicester. Despite it being a holiday, they opened the library for my use and helped collect the information from its shelves and the internet.<a href="#p6" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p7"></span>٥. My son Muhammad Abid Hasan and his wife Linda for arranging the material, typing the manuscript, and later retrieving it from near-loss. To type up the work in such a short space of time was an achievement in itself, but retrieving it from a collapsing disk was much greater.<a href="#p7" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p8"></span>٦. My eldest daughter Khola Hasan who continues to be the editor of all my contributions in English.<a href="#p8" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p> </div>
